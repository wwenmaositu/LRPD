# LRPD
LRPD encompasses 168 videos of 42 subjects, captured across diverse visible-light environments. For each subject, there are three 1-minute sessions with three lighting scenes including Lux 3.0, Lux 8.0, and Lux 35.0. During each session, facial videos are recorded by an RGB camera with an adjustable LED light and an NIR camera with an 850-nm NIR illuminator. In addition, ground truth PPG signals and HR are recorded by a pulse oximeter. Finally, the dataset structure is as follows:
